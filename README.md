# Object_Detection_using-Open-CV


Overview

This project is designed to detect a wide range of objects in images or video streams using a computer vision model. The objects that can be detected include everyday items, vehicles, animals, and more. By integrating this project with a camera and machine learning modules, it can be further extended for advanced applications, such as tracking individuals and generating records in real-time.

Features

Electronics and Appliances: TV, laptop, mouse, remote, keyboard, cell phone, microwave, oven, toaster, sink, refrigerator, blender.

Miscellaneous: Book, clock, vase, scissors, teddy bear, hair dryer, toothbrush, hairbrush.

Future Functionalities

This project has the potential to evolve into more advanced applications:

Student Attendance Tracking: By integrating a machine learning module containing a database of individuals, the system can:

Detect people entering and leaving a classroom.

Record how many times a student enters or exits.

Create a detailed attendance record.

Advanced Analytics: Generate reports and insights based on object detection data.

Customizable Detection: Expand the model to detect new categories of objects based on user needs.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Framework: TensorFlow or PyTorch (for object detection models)

Hardware Integration: Camera module for real-time video feed

How to Use

Setup Environment:

Install Python (>= 3.8).

Install required libraries using the command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Detection Model:

Use the provided script to run object detection on images or a live camera feed:

python detect_objects.py

Integration with Camera:

Ensure your camera is connected and accessible.

Modify the configuration file to enable real-time detection.
